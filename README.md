I am a passionate, creative, and detail-oriented software development bootcamp student excited to pivot my 9-year-long career in retail into the stimulating world of tech. For as long as I can remember, I've had a huge interest in technology and problem-solving. I was always the person that my family, friends, and co-workers would go to if they had an issue with some tech device. This desire and ability to efficiently find solutions to problems allowed me to thrive in my previous role as a retail Operations Manager. I was able to use and develop my creativity and problem-solving skills in this role, such as by executing monthly visual product launch presentations.

Unfortunately, however, I wasn't able to explore my true passion for technology in the retail field. That's why I decided to take the plunge and am now enrolled in the Java Development bootcamp program at Tech Elevator. Here, I am learning the skills needed to start a career in the software development industry. After graduating, I am looking for a junior developer position where I can utilize my skills to effectively create solutions to business problems. I am excited to work for a company where I can be challenged, and where I can continue to grow and learn.
