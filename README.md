### :technologist: About Me :

Hey there! My name's Derek and I'm a passionate, creative, and detail-oriented software development bootcamp student excited to pivot my 9-year-long career in retail into the stimulating world of tech. For as long as I can remember, I've had a huge interest in technology and problem-solving. I was always the person that my family, friends, and co-workers would go to if they had some kind of issue with their computer. I loved trying to solve their problem by first messing around with it myself, and if that failed by doing some research to try and find a fix. This desire and ability to efficiently find solutions to problems allowed me to thrive in my previous role as an Operations Manager in retail. I was able to use and develop my creativity and problem-solving skills in this role in many ways, such as by executing monthly visual product launch presentations.

Unfortunately, however, I wasn't able to explore my true passion for technology in the retail field. That's why I decided to take the plunge and am now enrolled in the Java Development bootcamp program at Tech Elevator. Here, I am learning the skills needed to start a career in the software development industry. After graduating, I am looking for a junior developer position where I can utilize my skills to effectively create solutions to business problems. I am excited to work for a company where I can be challenged, and where I can continue to grow and learn.
